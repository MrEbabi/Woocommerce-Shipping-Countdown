Kindly check the "timer.php" code and "example-output.jpg", for the JS part only check "timer.js" code.

Code includes 3 parts: CSS, HTML and JS.

Comments inside the code will help you to understand better.

Add those codes to any page you want in the Wordpress/WooCommerce (actually you can use it without Wordpress/Woocommerce, like any HTML or PHP websites).

Example use: 

If you are using Wordpress/Woocommerce do as following:

Open > wp-content -> themes -> your_theme -> front-page.php
Attention: Be  careful about the PHP tags.
Add the code with using opening and closing PHP tags before and after the code, ?> and <?php respectively.
Then you will see the example-output.jpg
