JS Code For Woocommerce Shipping Countdown

Kindly check the "timer" code and "example-output.jpg".

Code includes 3 parts: CSS, HTML and JS.

Comments inside the code will help you to understand better.

Add those codes to any page you want in the Wordpress/WooCommerce (actually you can use it without Wordpress/Woocommerce, like any HTML or PHP websites).

Example use: 
              Open > wp-content -> themes -> your_theme -> front-page.php
              Add the code with using opening and closing PHP tags before and after the code, ?> and <?php respectively.
              Then you will see the example-output.jpg
